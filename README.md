# React-App-REST-API
This app simulates a multipurpose course portal, where anyone can view the course catalog and a logged in user can create courses, as well as update and delete the courses they created. It is the Unit 10 final project for the online Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree program offered by <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/full-stack-javascript" target="_blank">Team Treehouse</a>.

This repo contains two separate applications: a simulated backend comprised of SQLite and a REST API that can be launched by navigating to the /api folder and running:

```bash
  npm install
  npm start
```

The frontend that can be launched by navigating to the /client folder and running:

```bash
  npm install
  npm start
```

The purpose of this app is to demonstrate many of the full stack JavaScript concepts learned throughout this online tech degree program.

## Tech Stack

Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript\
Environment: Node.js (Express)\
Frameworks: React (Router, Dom, Markdown)\
Database: SQLite (ORM Sequelize)\
Tools: nodemon, axios, js-cookie

## Core Concepts

Backend:
 * SQLite database setup 
 * Defining data models + data validation
 * Creating a REST API: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE 
 * Testing APIs with Postman
 * CORS support (this is a local hosted backend for a locally run client to simulate a real backend)
 * User authenticaion middleware + hashed passowrds + conditional API calls

Frontend:
* Basic HTML and CSS
* Create React App
* Form submissions
* Props / local state
* React Router / dynamic navigation
* React Context API / global state
* Higher-Order React Components
* Header + dynamic component renders
* User authentication
* Using a REST API: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE 
* Error handling (validation, unauthorized, 404, undhandled)
* Misc middleware
* Async function calls
