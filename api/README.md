# Rest-API
This is a simulated backend for a <a href="https://github.com/alexcartaz/React-App" target="_blank">React App client</a> simulating viewing, creating, updating, and deleting courses by instructors. It is part of Units 9 and 10 for the online Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree program offered by <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/full-stack-javascript" target="_blank">Team Treehouse</a>.

Here is a Postman screenshot listing the valid endpoints:

 * Defining data models + data validation
 * REST API: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE 
 * Testing APIs with Postman
 * CORS support (this is a local hosted backend for a locally run client to simulate a real backend)
 * User authenticaion middleware + hashed passowrds + conditional API calls
